# 🤖 Building AI Chat Agents with LangChain, Chainlit & GitHub Models

> **A 90-minute hands-on workshop for tech conferences**

Welcome to this practical workshop where you'll build a fully functional AI chat agent from scratch! By the end of this session, you'll have created an intelligent assistant that can have conversations, call external tools (like fetching weather data), and integrate with the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

---

## 🎯 What You'll Build

A conversational AI agent with:
- **Real-time chat interface** powered by Chainlit
- **LLM backbone** using GitHub Models (completely free!)
- **Tool calling** capabilities (weather API integration)
- **MCP integration** for extensible agent capabilities

## 👨‍🏫 For Workshop Facilitators

### Before the Workshop
1. Ensure attendees have received the prerequisites checklist
2. Have backup GitHub tokens ready for attendees who forgot
3. Test the WeatherAPI endpoint is responding
4. Prepare a hotspot/backup internet option

### During the Workshop
- Each phase has a checkpoint - don't proceed until 80%+ have passed
- The `solutions/` folder contains working code for each phase
- Common issues are documented at the end of each phase
